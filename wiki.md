Developed and published by Konami Amusement Co., Ltd., Sound Voltex (**SDVX**) is a rhythm game series that started in Japan and has now made it's presence in aracades across the globe. 

## How to Play
Sound Voltex is a rhythm game that takes you beyond the bounds of buttons. Utilizing the function of knob turning, it takes rhythm gaming to a new dimension by providing an innovative and more interactive way to play rhythm games.

The controller consists of 4 main buttons (BT buttons), two thumb buttons (FT buttons), two knobs (one left and one right), and a main/start button. Players push the corresponding BT and FT buttons and turn the knobs to the rythm of the music as notes and slider fall down the note *highway* or more commonly called *lane*.

## Personal Account
SDVX implements a personal account system through Konami and e-amusement for players to track statistics, customize their gameplay, and more!

#### Crew Members and Appeal Cards
Appeal cards are used as a players identifying graphic (profile picture).

Crew members are characters that will cheer you on as you play the game: greeting you as you sign in, saying goodbye as you sign out, congratulating you or cheering you up upon song completion, etc.

## Game Versions
Like most games, SDVX went through many upgrades and releases. As it is originally an arcade game that is played on a *cabinet*, there were different versions that were released over time after release. Here are the versions in order from oldest to newest:

#### Setting Up PC Host Client Version
For a more detailed guide and walkthrough on how to set up SDVX for at home play on PC, a link to a step-by-step guide is provided in the "See also" section below. Here's a quick rundown of the steps:

1.) create a **Japanese** Konami/e-amusement account
2.) Download the Launcher for the game [here](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/eacsdvx/vi/download/index.html)

After launching the game you will see you are limited to 3 days of play and also only 5 songs

3.) provide payment method to Konami account (credit card)
4.) purchase the monthly subscription (~$12/month) to play the game [here](https://p.eagate.573.jp/payment/p/course_detail.html?course=eac_sdvx_basic)
5.) **For more songs** go [here](https://p.eagate.573.jp/gate/p/eamusement/coop/list.html?shop=1&category=45&cc=0&ls=1) - *also paywall for song packs*

**Controllers for PC**
You are able to bind keyboard and other things you may want to use for your knobs. However, it is best to get a controller as this game has quite the unique controls. The one I would reccommend is the [FauceTwo](https://www.gamo2.com/en/product/faucetwo/) with Sanwa buttons, 60g BT button springs and 100g FT button springs.
